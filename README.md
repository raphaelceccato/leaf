# leaf
A very simple and minimalist game engine/library that uses SDL2, OpenGL and OpenAL

## How to use
To begin, create a Engine object and use the createWindow() function. See the test project included for an example code.

## Building
This repo contains a Visual Studio solution file with both static and DLL targets.
It also contains a simple test program that shows a image on the screen

To build you must have the following dependencies installed:
```
glm
SDL2
glad
OpenAL
freealut
SOIL
```

## TODO
Make API documentation
