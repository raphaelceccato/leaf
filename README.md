# leaf
A very simple and minimalist header-only game engine/library that uses SDL2, OpenGL and OpenAL and is based on C++17

## How to use
To begin, include ```leaf.h```, create a Engine object and then use the createWindow() function. See the test project included for an example code.

## Dependencies
To use the library you must have the following dependencies installed:
```

```

## TODO
Make API documentation
